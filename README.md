### Hi there 👋

https://github.com/miharajster/miharajster/blob/main/lib/invideo-ai-720.mp4

I'm Miha Rajšter (Michael), coming from Slovenia (EU) and I've started coding my first web pages around the 2000s. I also run a company, called Lumnium - "Illuminating your dreams" that was formed in December 2015. 
My favorite OS is LINUX, but I'm a huge proponent of using whatever makes your task easyer, so I normally run the second latest Microsoft OS.
In my spare time I like to spend my time with my two cats Zoe and Stormy, collecting and repairing old Nintendo hardware and making my own with Atmel or RaspberryPi.

> [!NOTE]
> "Nootropics (/noʊ.əˈtroʊpɪks/ noh-ə-TROHP-iks or /noʊ.əˈtrɒpɪks/ noh-ə-TROP-iks[1]) (colloquial: brain supplements, smart drugs and cognitive enhancers) are numerous natural, semi-synthetic and synthetic molecules that claim to improve cognitive functions (such as executive functions, attention, memory, creativity)."
> Wikipedia

My basic stack is built with: 🍄 Lion's Mane, 🌿 Ginkgo, 🧪 Vitamin D3 and B12. It really helps with clarity and memory.
