### Hi there 👋
I'm Miha Rajšter (Michael), coming from Slovenia (EU) and I've started coding my first web pages around the 2000s. I also run a company, called Lumnium - "Illuminating your dreams" that was formed in December 2015. 
My favorite OS is LINUX, but I'm a huge proponent of using whatever makes your task easyer, so I normally run the second latest Microsoft OS.
In my spare time I like to spend my time with my two cats Zoe and Stormy, collecting and repairing old Nintendo hardware and making my own with Atmel or RaspberryPi.

### 🐱‍💻 I work with 
- HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, SCSS, SASS
- Bootstrap, Animate, Bulma, Materialize
- **PHP**, CakePHP, Laravel, Sinfony
- JavaScript, jQuery, TypeScript, Vue (VueEX), **Angular** (RyJS, e2e, unit), Ract, React Native
- MySQL, **MariaDB**, PostgreSQL, Restful API-s, Oauth, Keycloak
- OpenCV
- Pascal, ActionScript, Basic, Java, Python (Django), Bash, Batch, C, C++, C#...

### 💊 I'm also a big nootropics guy, and my current stack is
- Lion's Mane, Ginkgo, Huperzine A, Uridine Monophosphate, Omega-3
- Vitamin D3, C, B1, B2, B3, B5 B6, B9, B12, Magnesium, Zinc
- and abnormally big doses of laboratory grade Coffeine

My basic stack is built with: 🍄 Lion's Mane, 🌿 Ginkgo, 🧪 Vitamin D3 and B12. It really helps with clarity and memory.
